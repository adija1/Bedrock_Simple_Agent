# Bedrock_Simple_Agent
A CDK for setting up an Agent + KB + Action

# Setup RAG Stack with CDK

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions to provision Bedrock agents.
- Python 3.11 (that's what i used at time of creation...)
- AWS CLI
- CDK CLI

## Step 1: Clone the repositry
```
git clone https://github.com/adija1/Bedrock_Simple_Agent
cd Bedrock_Simple_Agent
```

## Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Run the following command and enter your AWS credentials (Ensure that the credentials used have the necessary permissions to create and manage Bedrock
agents)

```
aws configure
```

## Step 3: Install CDK if you haven't done so already

```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

## Step 4: Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 5: Setup environment variables

```
export ACCOUNT_ID=<your-account-id>
export ACCOUNT_REGION=<your-region>
export RAG_PROJ_NAME=<your-project-name>
```

## Step 6: Bootstrap & synth the stack

```
cdk bootstrap
cdk synth
```


## Step 7: Deploy the stack

```
cdk deploy S3Stack
cdk deploy KbRoleStack
cdk deploy OpenSearchServerlessInfraStack
cdk deploy LambdaStack
cdk deploy KbInfraStack
```
## Once the script runs successfully, navigate to the AWS Console:
## Step 8: Sync the Knowledgebase

1. Navigate to the S3 and choose the bucket that was provisioned by the stack

2. Upload documents for bedrock agent to use as knowledge base, here i using following document for demo: [GreenhouseEffectArchive.pdf](https://www.healthandenvironment.org/docs/ToxipediaGreenhouseEffectArchive.pdf)
3. Navigate to the Bedrock and click on Knowledge Base on the left panel, you should see like this:

4. Click on the Knowledge Bases
5. Tick on the Data Source (s3) and click on sync:

## Step 9: Test Bedrock Agent

1. In Bedrock console click on Agents on the left panel, you should see that your agent is in NOT_PREPARED status.

4. Test with knowledge base, you can ask anything from the document, for example ask about the greenhouse effect and you will see that the agent will also reference the document:

5. Test the action group by asking about temperature of a City and see how it uses the Lambda function

## Destroy the stack(s)

```
cdk destroy --all 
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add them to your setup.py file and rerun the pip install -r requirements.txt command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
